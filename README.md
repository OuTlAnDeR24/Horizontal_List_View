# Horizontal_List_View
Implemented a horizontal List View using Horizontal Scroll View and Linear Layout.

Since, android doesn't provides HorizontalListView hence I implemented my own using HorizontalScrollView and Linear 
Layouts. I have dynamically created fragments and inserted them into my main_activity ScrollView.

-> The app contains an excel file through which it reads data when it first time resumes. 
-> Then the data from the excel file is imported into an SQL database.
-> Then, I have implemented a "Horizontal ListView" inside a ScrollView to display the data.

This might help. Feel free to use the code in your application and suggest changes into the same if you feel it can be 
optimized further.
